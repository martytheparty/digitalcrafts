      JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
      It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.  Alongside
      HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide
      Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web
      browsers support it.

      JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF
      documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster
      JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also
      increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications.
      On the client side, developers have traditionally implemented JavaScript as
      an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation.
      Programmers also use JavaScript in video-game development, in crafting desktop
      and mobile applications, and in server-side network programming with run-time
      environments such as Node.js.
