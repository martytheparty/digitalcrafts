/*

The DOM stands for

Document - HTML pages are documents
Object - The DOM is an object that describes the document (attributes and behaviors)
Model - The DOM is an object in memory that can be read and written to via JS.

JavaScript is executed on platforms.  The browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE)
are a platform.  Another plaform is Node.

The DOM is not JavaScript; it is browser (platform) specific.  When a web browser
loads a DOM is created.  JavaScript in non-browser implementations (like node)
may not have a DOM to reference.

This is an example of a file that works on the browser plaform.
